- adapt the medium for each substrate separately and test if a bacterium can grow on each carbon source exclusively (instead of just checking if the bacterium can uptake the molecule)

- try gapseq -w approach to predict growth on substrates based on electron donors. This should increase specificity

- main.py: replace all occurrences of .max() with an argument (e.g. via groupby(...).agg(["max"]) or smth similar)
